# Language Translator - AP CSP Performance Task

## Overview

This Python project is designed to fulfill the requirements of the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) Performance Task. It utilizes the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Google's googletrans library for language translation functionality. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly language translator that allows users to input text in one language and obtain the translated text in another language.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The application provides a simple and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to interact with the translator easily.

- **Language Translation:** Utilizes Google's googletrans library to perform language translation. Users can input text in a source language and receive the translation in a target language of their choice.

- **Supported Languages:** The translator supports a wide range of languages, making it versatile for various translation needs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library
- googletrans library (install using `pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WishKish/languageTranslator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd language-translator
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. The GUI will appear, allowing you to input text in the source language, select the target language, and perform the translation.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The googletrans library is used for language translation and does not require an API key.
